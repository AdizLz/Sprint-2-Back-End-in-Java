### **JSON to CSV Converter Project**

This repository contains a desktop Java application that reads data from a JSON file and converts it into a CSV file. The goal is to demonstrate data manipulation and the use of external libraries in a Java project.

### **Project Structure**

* `src/`: Contains the Java source code.
    * `Main.java`: Coordinates the reading of JSON and writing of CSV. **It now accepts file names as command-line arguments.**
    * `JsonReader.java`: Reads and parses a JSON file using the Gson library.
    * `CsvWriter.java`: Writes data into a CSV file using the OpenCSV library.
* `data.json`: Example input file with JSON data.
* `output.csv`: Example output file generated by the program.

### **Requirements**

* Java 17 installed
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Gson library (managed by Maven)
* OpenCSV library (managed by Maven)

### **Transformation Algorithm**

The program converts data from a "key-value" format (JSON) to a tabular format (CSV). The `JsonReader` class reads the JSON file and interprets it as a list of objects. Then, the `CsvWriter` class takes these objects, uses the JSON keys to create the CSV columns, and populates the rows with the corresponding values.

### **How to Run**

To run the program, you must pass the file names as arguments on the command line or in your IDE's run configuration.

**In IntelliJ IDEA:**
1.  Open the project and go to **Run > Edit Configurations...**.
2.  In the **"Program arguments"** field, enter the path to your input JSON file and the path to your output CSV file, separated by a space.
    * **Example:** `data.json output.csv`
3.  Click "Run" to execute the program.
